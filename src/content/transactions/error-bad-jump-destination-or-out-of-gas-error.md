"My transaction has a  [Bad jump destination] or [Out of Gas] error. When do I get my ETH back?"

When a transaction fails due to a [Bad jump destination] or [Out of Gas] error, the ETH actually never leave your account. If you [check your balance](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/getting-started/checking-balance-of-my-account.html) on etherscan.io or ethplorer.io or MyEtherWallet, you should see the amount you had before.

There are a lot of complicated things about gas and transactions, especially during ICO-times, but luckily [we have a pretty sweet write-up that should help clarify things.](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/gas/what-is-gas-ethereum.html)
