This is fixed when updating the ETH application from Ledger Manager.

You can learn how to do this here: [https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165409-How-can-I-update-my-Nano-S-](https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165409-How-can-I-update-my-Nano-S-)

If that doesn't work, you may need to delete the application and install it again.

Before you update or delete the application, **ensure you have properly backed up your 24 word recover phrase for your Ledger and have it handy in case you need it**.
