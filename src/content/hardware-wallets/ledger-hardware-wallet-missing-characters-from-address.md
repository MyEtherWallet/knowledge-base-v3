This is fixed when updating the ETH application from Ledger Manager.

You can learn how to do this here: [https://ledger.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/firmware-upgrade-and-application-manager](https://ledger.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/firmware-upgrade-and-application-manager)

If that doesn't work, you may need to delete the application and install it again.

Before you update or delete the application, **ensure you have properly backed up your 24 word recover phrase for your Ledger and have it handy in case you need it**.
