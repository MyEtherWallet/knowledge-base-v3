Adding a new token / sending custom tokens / checking balance of tokens / seeing custom token / ERC-20

Any ERC-20 token can be added to your local MEW interface by following these instructions.


### Make sure it isn't already in the list:

1. Click the Orange "Show All Tokens" Button.

2. Scroll and click the token you want to load, where it says "Click to Load". You can also use `cmd/ctrl`+`f` to search for a token on the list more quickly.

3. If you have a balance you won't have to load it againâ€”it will automatically load in the future.

### Removing Custom Tokens

To remove a custom token, click the little ( - ) icon next to your token. This will remove it from the interface (browser?). It is not deleting or removing the tokens themselves. They are still safely in your wallet, we promise.
