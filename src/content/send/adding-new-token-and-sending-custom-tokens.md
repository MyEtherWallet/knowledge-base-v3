Adding a new token / sending custom tokens / checking balance of tokens / seeing custom token / ERC-20

#### First, make sure you have clicked the orange `"Load Tokens"` button.

#### If you still don't see your token, you simply need to add it to your interface:

Any ERC-20 token can be added to your local MEW interface by following these instructions.

1.  Go to [Ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/) 
2.  Type in the name of the token, or search to your address and click on the Token's name there. 
3.  At the very top is the address.
4.  Down below that there is a thing called "decimals", which is a number between 0 and 18.
4.  In a new tab, navigate to the ["Send Ether & Tokens](https://www.myetherwallet.com/#send-transaction)" page on MyEtherWallet.
5.  Unlock your wallet.
6.  Click "Add Custom Token" on the right side.
7.  Enter the `address` you got from Ethplorer.io.
8.  Type in what you want to call it - the name or the symbol.
9.  Enter the `decimals` from Ethplorer.io.
10.  Click `"Save"`.

🎉 You can now send your new token and see it's balance in the sidebar!


In the future, we may add this token as a "Default" token on MyEtherWallet. In that case, you will see two of that token in the sidebar. While this won't break anything, it can be annoying. 

To remove a custom token, click the little ( - ) icon next to your token. This will remove it from the interface. It is not deleting or removing the tokens themselves. They are still safely in your wallet, we promise.
