[Ethplorer.io](https://ethplorer.io/) is a great way to explore tokens and find the decimals of a token.

1.  Navigate to the "Send Ether & Tokens" page.
2.  Unlock your wallet.
3.  Enter the address you would like to send to in the "To Address:" field.
4.  Enter the amount you would like to send.
5.  Select which token you would like to send.
6.  **If you do not see the token listed:**

      *  In the sidebar, click "Add Custom Token".
      *  Enter the address, name, and decimals of the token. These are provided by the developers of the token and are also needed when you "Add a Watch Token" to Mist.
      *  Click "Save".
      *  You can now send that token as well as see it's balance in the sidebar.

8.  Click "Generate Transaction".
9.  A couple more fields will appear. This is your browser generating the transaction.
10.  Click the blue "Send Transaction" button below that.
11.  A pop-up will appear. Verify that the amount and the address you are sending to are correct. Then click "Yes, I am sure! Make transaction." button.
12.  The transaction will be submitted. The TX ID will display. You can click that TX ID to see it on the blockchain.
