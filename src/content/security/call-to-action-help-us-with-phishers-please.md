  <b>These phucks will not stop until they stop getting money or get caught.</b> We don't have the time or manpower to do it all. There are so many things to do and watch and document. We thank you for your help.
</p>

### 1. Educate when you see a message
<ul>
  <li id="1-educate-when-you-see-a-message-l1">If you see a link to one of these sites or a fake Token Sale address, comment on it in #general or on Twitter or on Reddit or wherever. Warn people QUICKLY & LOUDLY. </li>
</ul>

<p id="1-educate-when-you-see-a-message-p1">
  "There are scammers that are DMing, posting links, posting comments, and trying to get you to navigate to fake URLs. DO NOT CLICK IT!" (Yes. People still don't know this. I don't know where they are, obviously not here on reddit).
</p>
<p id="1-educate-when-you-see-a-message-p2">
  Remind people: "If it's to good to be true, it probably is."
</p>
<p id="1-educate-when-you-see-a-message-p3">
  ⚠ PSA! Do NOT click the link or listen to the scammer! That is a phishing site. Always check your URL and/or consider getting a Ledger or TREZOR hardware wallet.
</p>

<p id="1-educate-when-you-see-a-message-p4">
  If you have a moment, please report the recent malicious site ` myetherwallet[.]su ` as phishing to Google via [https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/) and [https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware/). If you have IE, do the same via Tools -> Report as Malicious Site so they can't trick anymore people.
</p>


### 2. Educate *before* you see a message
<p id="2-educate-before-you-see-a-message-p1">
This is too much for one post so help spread the word: Private keys are *private*. Use hardware wallets. Use cold storage. Go offline. Check URLs.

  I am writing to you today to report a malicious website on your service: `insert_domain_here`. This website is posing as the legitimate site `myetherwallet.com`.
