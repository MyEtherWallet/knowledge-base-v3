"I can't withdraw them from your site because it is less than the minimum required to transfer?"

There actually is no minimum to transfer as we are not an exchange and have no way of blocking your withdrawals or deposits.

The minimum is the minimum amount of gas needed to complete the transaction. For a standard transaction, that is 0.000441 Ether.

If you have 0.00X in your account and want to empty your account completely, send 0.01 ETH into the account and then use the "Send Entire Balance" button to send the entire balance out. This will leave you with a balance of 0.
